## Ukraine: Development of online data-driven monitoring methodologies and piloting analytical and monitoring tools by the State Audit Service of Ukraine </br> </br> _Development of concept – data-driven risk-based ex-ante monitoring of public procurement_

### Description:
The feasibility of a data-driven, evidence-based, and risk-based approach to public procurement control is demonstrated and prototyped methodologies and digital tools, including a set of risk-indicators for [Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/) structured data are produced in order to create the conceptual design of the digitised monitoring process and surrounding IT infrastructure, to identify main challenges and manage key stakeholders on their way to accept the new practice.

### Project timeline:

Nov 2018 – April 2019

### Project status:
In use by the SASU since 2019

## Context and problem statement
In April 2016, the [Public Procurement Law (Law)](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/922-19) came into force in Ukraine. Together with the new Law, the public procurement monitoring procedure was introduced. [The State Audit Service of Ukraine](http://www.dkrs.gov.ua/kru/en/) was assigned as the governmental authority responsible for performing public procurement monitoring.

According to the adopted amendments to the Law, the SASU may start the procurement procedure monitoring based on the triggered automated red flags and risk indicators defined by the monitoring methodology. In this regard, the Government of Ukraine requested [EBRD](https://www.ebrd.com/home) to assist in developing and piloting respective methodology and automated data-driven red flags as well as risk indicators tools for electronic public tenders’ official monitoring by SASU.

To fulfil the Law requirements, the development efforts were organised in two projects. Under the first project, the electronic Auditor’s Cabinet had to be developed and attached to the [Prozorro](https://prozorro.gov.ua) – an open-source [OCDS](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/) open data electronic public procurement system of Ukraine. The SOE “Prozorro” team took ownership of this project. 

The second project focused on the development of the automated tool, which can provide online analysis of the Prozorro public procurement Open Data and reference it against developed red flags and risk indicators automated algorithms. The results of the analysis had to be visible in the Auditor’s Cabinet to enable state auditors to decide on monitoring initiation according to the Law.

## Objectives and vision
Working with the EBRD GPA Technical Cooperation Facility, the SASU and [the Ministry for Development of Economy, Trade and Agriculture (MDETA)](https://www.me.gov.ua/?lang=en-GB) aimed to develop the pilot product for automated red flags and risk indicator monitoring tool in order to **translate the “red flag and risk indicators style” risk-based methodology into automated tools for the official monitoring**. The development of the tool served to **prove the concept** that it is possible for the **modern risk management process to be implemented in the Ukrainian procurement monitoring ecosystem** and that the **procurement process risks can be identified by applying automated red flags and risk indicators** to the procurement e-data and then addressed by authorised state bodies.

The EBRD-developed vision to achieve these objectives contained two primary workstreams:
•	Development of a concept with the initial set of risk indicators and a concept of procurement procedures risk-based prioritisation for ex-ante monitoring of the electronic public procurement procedures by SASU, in accordance with the latest amendments to the Public Procurement Law of Ukraine;
•	Development of prototypes of indicators engine and risk-based procurement procedures prioritisation engine for monitoring public procurement by SASU.
