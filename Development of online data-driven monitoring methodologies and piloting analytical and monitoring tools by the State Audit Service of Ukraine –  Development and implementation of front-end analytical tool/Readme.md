## Ukraine: Development of online data-driven monitoring methodologies and piloting analytical and monitoring tools by the State Audit Service of Ukraine </br> </br> _Development of online data-driven monitoring methodologies and piloting analytical and monitoring tools by the State Audit Service of Ukraine – Development and implementation of front-end analytical tool_

### Description:

The [SASU](http://www.dkrs.gov.ua/kru/en/) auditors were supported in piloting the developed conceptual design of the data-driven and risk-based digital procurements monitoring approach; a tool that could automatically consolidate the procurement procedures risk data accumulated in real-time to enable auditors effectively and quickly select procedures for monitoring as well as to analyse sets of procurement procedures in various dimensionswas was developed.

### Project timeline:

Aug 2019 – Jan 2020

### Project status:
In use by the SASU since January 2020

## Context and problem statement
To analyse information signalling the presence of signs of violation in the field of public procurement, [the State Audit Service of Ukraine (SASU)](http://www.dkrs.gov.ua/kru/en/) needs to process a huge amount of data from various sources. In 2019, with the cooperation between the Government of Ukraine, Transparency International Ukraine and the [EBRD](https://www.ebrd.com/home), a set of automatic risk indicators was developed that indicate the likelihood of the existence of offences in procurement procedures. 

Under the TC project, the software, including 35 automated risk indicators, was successfully implemented and put into operation. This software automatically checks procurement procedures against developed risk indicators and forms an ordered list of procedures that have been recognised as risky. The ordered list of selected risky procedures then is shown in the electronic Auditor’s Cabinet, developed by SE “Prozorro” as an auditor’s dedicated tool for initiation and conducting monitoring process as well as official communication with the contracting entities within the monitoring procedure and publication of the monitoring conclusion.

However, the state auditors expressed interest in the functionality that was not covered by the developed solution. What they had in the Auditor’s Cabinet was that for all risky procedures in a queue marked as a priority, the system generated drafts for future monitoring automatically. To be able to understand for which procedure the draft was created and what indicators showed the positive calculation results for this procedure, the auditor had to go inside the draft. As a result, the auditor was forced to go manually throughout all drafts to select the required data, and this procedure could take a lot of time.

In addition, the Auditor’s Cabinet offered no filters, search engine or other useful functionality for querying as well as processing monitoring drafts. SASU had need of analytical infrastructure and additional technical capacity to analyse procurement procedures more efficiently and focus on those procurement procedures where the risk of violation is the most likely and/or that could potentially cause significant losses of public funds.

## Objectives and vision
Working with the [EBRD](https://www.ebrd.com/home) GPA Technical Cooperation Facility, the [SASU](http://www.dkrs.gov.ua/kru/en/) and [MDETA](https://www.me.gov.ua/?lang=en-GB) aimed to modernise existing public procurement monitoring infrastructure by introducing a modern user-friendly electronic analytical tool that could support auditors by automatically consolidating transactions data accumulated in real-time from various Open Data sources to enable them to:
-	analyse sets of procurement procedures in various dimensions, and 
-	effectively and quickly select procedures for monitoring. 

The EBRD-developed vision to achieve these objectives contained two primary workstreams:
-	Development and implementation of the front-end analytical tool for exploring and queuing ‘red-flags’ based transactional risk indicators with the methodology for procedures queue forming, KPI calculation and their visual interpretation;
-	Conducting an online training session for end-users – members of the SASU staff responsible for monitoring public procurement to enable them to implement eProcurement audit activities.
